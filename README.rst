========================================
Course
------
- **Course link:** `threejs-journey.com <https://threejs-journey.com/>`_
- **Course content:**

  - 7 chapters, 53 lessons, 71 hours of videos
  - The first 4 lessons are free 
- **Course description:**

   "The course is complete, yet accessible for beginners. We will start by discovering what WebGL is and why using 
   the Three.js library is a must. We will then discover the various components of Three.js and once the basics are acquired, 
   we will move on to more advanced techniques to display millions of particles, add physics, add interactions, create a 
   galaxy, animate a raging sea, etc.
   
   At the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of Three.js and enough experience to start your own projects.
   
   As a bonus, we will also learn how to use the 3D software Blender to be able to create our own models."
- **Prerequisites:**

  - JavaScript basics: like variables, objects, arrays, loops, functions, conditions and events
  - Code editor: He recommends Visual Studio Code but you can use any editor you like
  - Browser: He recommends Chrome and Firefox (for their good developer tools) but you can use any browser you like
  - Blender: "Eventually, you will have to install Blender, but the software is free and works on all major OS"
